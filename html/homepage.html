     <p>
          Programmer with 3+ years professional experience working with variety of
          clients, managers, and companies to provide technical solutions. I am
          currently a Developer at Capgemini using tools such as HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Angular, and ServiceNow to problem solve and create products.
          I am also experience with automation, utilizing tools such as AWS,
          Jenkins, Github Actions, and Azure to create scripts & workflows that
          assist the CI/CD process and ensuring that there is synergy on development
          and delivering to clients across all workstreams. My past experiences at
          different companies have given me the opportunity to take on multiple
          roles such as Developer, Mentor, Architect, Team Lead, and Change Manager.
          My passion for develping & problem solving means I am endlessly looking
          for ways to challenge myself and gain knowledge about new tools and best
          practices.
